				<p>Computer programming encompasses all activities related to the design, writing, testing, and maintenance of computer programs using programming languages. A core skill in contemporary engineering, it plays a role 
				   in the development of software, applications, operating systems, and digital devices at the heart of all sectors of society.</>
        <p>A program is written in a programming language . Software is a set of programs (which can be written in different programming languages) intended to perform certain tasks by one (or more) users of the software.</p>
        <p>Programming, therefore, refers here to writing the source code of a software program. The term " development" is more commonly used to denote all the activities related to creating software and the programs that
				   compose it. This includes software specification, design, and then its actual implementation in the sense of writing programs in a well-defined programming language, as well as verifying its correctness, etc.</p>
        <p>Long perceived as a mere technical tool, programming is now recognized as a culturally and socially significant practice. It shapes our digital habits, our modes of communication, and even our social and economic
				   structures. Researchers such as Lev Manovich and Shoshana Zuboff have highlighted the structuring role of software in our contemporary digital culture and the power relations that emerge from it.</p>
        <p>Programming is not neutral: it involves technical and ethical choices that can reinforce or mitigate algorithmic biases, as Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru demonstrated in the Gender Shades study.
				   It is also at the heart of debates on inclusion in digital professions, documented in particular by Mar Hicks and Janet Abbate.</p>
        <p>Finally, it is embedded in vibrant social dynamics: open-source communities, cooperative platforms like GitHub, and educational initiatives aimed at democratizing coding education. Anthropologist Gabriella Coleman
				   sees in it an ethic of sharing and freedom shaped by the developers themselves.</p>
				<h2>Different programming languagues</h2>
				<ul id="bul1">
					<li>JavaScript</li>
					<li>Python</li>
					<li>Java</li>
					<li>Swift</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Program Testing</h2>
				<p>This is one of the most important steps in creating a program. In principle, every programmer should check and test every part of a program. There are different types of tests. In particular, we can mention:</p>
				<ul id="bul2">
					<li>Unit test</li>
					<li>Integration test</li>
					<li>Performance test</li>
				</ul>
